# liri-node-app
 LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

 It is a simple and fast way to find information you are interested in without overwhelming you with superfluous details.

 It will show you your last 20 tweets and when they were created. It will bring back targed information about any movie title you search for and will do the same for song titles.
